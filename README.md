# MoodRingOximeter
Arduino-based Pulse Oximeter

# Introduction
This pulse oximeter was built using Arduino and several basic electronic components (red LED, IR LED, photodiode, LCD monitor, batteries). The algorithm controls the probe to measure PPG signal, converts PPG signal into digital samples, filters and displays the waveform, and calculates real-time heart rate and SpO2 level.
